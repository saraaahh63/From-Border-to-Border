From Border to Border is an immersive Virtual Reality experience that explores nostalgia, growing up, and being ensnared by the past. The experience takes the form of a journey in three parts: The Sandbox, The City, and The Sea. Throughout this journey, the visitor is both propelled forward by a vision of the sea and called back by an idealistic picture of the sand. In the end, the visitor finds the sea and realizes it was not what they envisioned. They are adrift and helpless, with only one way out.

The process of creating this project can be broken down into three sections: ideation, in which I began looking at works that inspired me and forming the concepts that would guide this piece; design, in which I laid out my initial plans for each location and the broader framework of the experience; and, finally, construction, in which I began building and compiling the final product.

Throughout this project I encountered several setbacks, most of which were due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and uncertainties in my living situation. Eventually, these setbacks became springboards into new avenues of storytelling that pushed this project into its final form.
